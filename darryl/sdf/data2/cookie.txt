Ive been wondering for some time
can't stop thinking bout those ocean eyes
careful cities and napalm skies 
No fairrrrrrrrrrr
You really know how to make me cry when you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scareddddd i've never fallen from quite this high 
falling into your ocean eyes
ocean eyes best song ever
